											<p><strong>In UX, illustrations help walk users through a website or app, adding to their overall experience and clarifying the product's message.</strong><br />
												It was author and illustrator Dr. Seuss who said, “words and pictures are yin and yang. Married, they produce a progeny more interesting than either parent.” Reading picture books such as Dr. Seuss’, or leafing through magazine articles with thought-provoking editorial pieces, can shed a light on the strong affinity between the textual and the visual.<br />
												Not unlike children’s books or editorial illustration, I look to evoke new meanings and spark crystal clear insights by the coming together of words and illustrations.<br />

												for example – is not looking to indulge in a nuanced reading experience. They are, however, looking for a friendly and reliable guide to lead them through the task at hand – and that’s precisely what UX illustration is meant to do.<br />

									<span class="date">October 4, 2019</span></i></button>	
								<div class="panel" >
											
											<div class="box">
											<p><strong>Firstly We must examine what is not a good UI·UX design?</strong><br />
												(1) It’s not about ‘complex’ designs. Good designs follow Ockham’s principle, that simplicity is king.<br />
												(2) It’s not about spending excessive time on each design. Good design, once mastered, is extremely fast and efficient. If it takes you a long time to a create good design, either you should stop being a UI·UX designer and become an artist, or you might just be lazy and lying to yourself.<br />
												(3) It’s not about simply making things look good. Design is more about math than about art. It’s a type of science — a social science, to be exact.<br />
												<b>Then what is UI·UX design?</b><br />
												Design is inherently about solving problems.<br /> <b>The first step in all design is to identify what exactly the design problem is.</b><br />Usually the problem comes in 2 steps, <b>‘Understanding what Relevant Functionality & Information Is’</b> and <b>‘How to Effectively Execute the Relevant Functionality & Information’</b>.<br />
												In short, UI·UX design is ‘a scientific process through which we solve problems regarding functionality and display of information under certain constraints.’<br />
												
												For instance, following is a UX Design Problem:<br />
												<b>UX Design Problem:</b> If the client is selling 120 different types of mattresses,each being a variant of the other,it is foreseeable that the customer will not be able to distinguish between product #119 and product #120. Thus, he may be overwhelmed by the options.<br />
												<b>Design Solution:</b> Let’s artificially divide the products into different classes.If each mattress is created by mixing together different layers of foams,<br /> and that foam is on the uppermost layer (the part that actually touches the body of the consumer) has the most impact on the mattress’s overall properties among all the foam layers of the mattress. <br />Thus, the type of foam that is on the uppermost layer will be the basis on which we will divide the 120 products into classes.

											<p><strong>There are 3 types of designers:</strong><br />
												<b>(1) Assistant Designers</b><br />
										These are the designers with rudimentary knowledge of text, colors and spacing (i.e. the lead says, ‘Draw me a butterfly’, and the designer draws a butterfly)<br />
										<b>(2) Pseudo-Artist-Designers</b><br />
										These are designers who can actively find solutions to design problems. However because of their ego (they are incapable of learning new things and processing feedback), they work alone and cannot function in a team setting.<br />
										<b>(3) Creative Directors</b><br />
										These are designers who actively find solutions to design problems, however they are capable of working in teams and leading a project (actively participating throughout even the development phases) to its completeness.<br />
