											<h2><b>Inspiration</b></h2>

								<p>When I started my first-ever Photoshop project in 2013, I knew nothing about it. I was an artist who like painting canvas. Photo shop made me realise the power of digital media 
									which opened up so many opportunities in the field of graphics and digital media. Since then I started learning Adobe Suit and creating compositions that would amaze everyone. After completing high school I started 
								working on freelance projects of graphics designing and video editing.</p>
								<p>It is my deepest belief that a good designer – one who understands design in its deepest and most thorough sense – can create in any field and excel. Moreover, I believe that cross-discipline collaborations are a crucial key to one’s self-development. That’s one of the reasons our design team consists of designers from diverse backgrounds. We have fashion designers and stylists, interior designers and illustrators, product designers and motion designers. All of these design fields have found a natural rhythm of growth in the tech world, and these designers have experienced the shift of consumers towards better, more beautifully designed products over the past years.</p>
								<h3><b>Beautiful = functional</b></h3>>
								<p>As products become an extension of ourselves, like our phones and digital wearables, the need for better looking apps and websites is rising as well. The old saying is ‘form follows function’ – but today, I believe form and function are one of the same. Functional, beautiful, usable or well-designed, it’s all part of what we now call ‘user experience’.</p>
								<p>We can see it as a combination of two elements. The first is the flow: the intent the user has when trying to use a product, and the outcome of this usage that results in either success or failure. The second is driven by design and content, which refers to the look, feel and tone of the product. To create a successful user experience in any type of product, you have to nail every piece – and for that reason, design has become an even more crucial part of the process.</p>

								<p>Well for inspiration, I always look out for live portraits and environment. I have a passion for photography 
									and I love taking pictures and converting them into Digital Design.
